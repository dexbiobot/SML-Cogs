    You may have been kicked for having a poor win percentage on collection day or war day.
    We take war very seriously and provide tools to help with deck creation.
    We encourage members to practice with each other and collaborate before attacking.


    If you decide to join a lower feeder please consider using the tools we have
    to increase your war success and remain in the 100T clan family.


    If clan wars is not your cup of tea, you may wish to join RoyaleAPI Z.
    Please use the passphrase “Life is a journey” when requesting.


    Our clans are Royale API A / B / C / D / E / F / G / Z
    with the red and blue sword emblem.
    Good luck on the ladder + the next war!
  k5alpha: >
    You have been kicked due to your card levels not being up to our expectancy.
    In Alpha, we require new members to have at least all Epics at level 7
    due to our high ranking in the Clan Wars Leaderboard.


    If you decide to join a lower feeder our clans are Royale API A / B / C / D / E / F / G / Z
    with the red and blue sword emblem.

    Good luck on the ladder + the next war!"
  bskick5050: >
    Sorry, but you were 50/50 and we have
    kicked you from the Brawl Stars band.
    Please join one of our feeders for now.
    Our clans are Alpha / Bravo / Charlie
    with the red skull emblem.
    Good luck in your future games!

    Thanks for your interest in joining our clan family. While we’re unable to approve your join request now, we’d love for you to hang around in our <#530523965232250880> channel and connect with us later after you’ve had a chance to progress your account by: upgrading cards / getting 12+ challenge wins / pushing on ladder.


    **Recruitment Criteria**

    While our clans are primarily focused on ladder results (RoyaleAPI A is a global top 25 ladder clan), we have a secondary focus on war and look for recruits that have 12+ challenge wins and decent clan war readiness levels.


    **Explanation of clan war readiness (CWR):**

    Legendary League Standard is level 12, so your Legendary League Readiness % is based on the number of cards at that level or higher. Again, 30-50%+ is the standard we look for today.


    In Legendary League, you can also see +1 levels (Legendary League Readiness level 13 — max cards) when you battle, so a player with 50% Legendary Readiness is better off than someone with 5% Legendary when it comes to building strong decks to go to battle with.
